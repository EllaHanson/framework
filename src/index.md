## 1. Dataset

I'm going to be using data from the SNAP benefits. They have data for every
state going back to 1988 and national data going back to 1969.

## 2. Analysis Question

I'm hoping to ask the percentage of people recieving SNAP benfits. I want to
try and show that its a program that serves a large amount of people. 

## 3. Visual Concept

I want to have a bubble chart that colors in the amount of people that get
SNAP benefits where each bubble is representitive of a number of people.
If I have the time, I'm hoping to add a gradient for the coloring to the
dots representing recipients of SNAP which denotes the amount of money that
people are recieving. 

## 4. Interaction Implementation

The implementation I'm going to add is some way to choose what year's data
to look at. This will likely be with a simple slider to pick the year. I 
possibly could also choose to add box selection for which state to look at.
